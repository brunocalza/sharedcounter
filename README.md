# Shared Counter Implementations

- Not Safe Counter
- Mutex Counter
- Channel Counter
- Atomic Counter
- Compare and Swap Counter
- Compare and Swap Float Counter

This is a result out of my curiosity on trying to find out multiple implementations of a shared counter. Eventually, I came across the talk [Prometheus: Designing and Implementing a Modern Monitoring Solution in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V7eJ0jN8-E) that was very influential on some implementations.
